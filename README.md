## Javascript History
JavaScript is an interpreted computer programming language that was built for the
Web. First implemented by the Netscape Navigator web browser, it became the
programming language that web browsers use to execute client-side logic. In the
mid 2000s, the shift from websites to web applications, along with the release of
faster browsers, gradually created a community of JavaScript developers writing
more complex applications. These developers started creating libraries and tools
that shortened development cycles, giving birth to a new generation of even more
advanced web applications, which in turn created a continuous demand for better
browsers. This cycle went on for a few years, where the vendors kept improving
their browsers and JavaScript developers kept pushing the boundaries. The real
revolution began in 2008, when Google released its Chrome browser, along with
its fast JIT-compiling V8 JavaScript engine. Google's V8 engine made JavaScript
run so much faster that it completely transformed web application development.
More importantly, the release of the engine's source code allowed developers to
start reimagining JavaScript outside of the browser. One of the irst products of this
revolution was Node.js.

After looking into other options for a while, programmer Ryan Dahl found that V8
engine it his non-blocking I/O experiment called Node.js. The idea was simple: help
developers build non-blocking units of code to allow better use of system resources
and create more responsive applications. The result was a minimal yet powerful
platform, which utilized JavaScript's non-blocking nature outside of the browser.
Node's elegant module system enabled developers to freely extend the platform
using third-party modules to achieve almost any functionality. The reaction by the
online community was a creation of various tools from modern web frameworks to
robotics server platforms. However, server-side JavaScript was only the beginning.

When Dwight Merriman and Eliot Horowitz set out to build their scalable hosting
solution back in 2007, they already had a lot of experience with building web
applications. However, the platform they built did not succeed as planned, so in 2009
they decided to take it apart and open source its components, including a V8-based
database called MongoDB. Derived from the word humongous, MongoDB was a
scalable NoSQL database that used a JSON-like data model with dynamic schemas.
MongoDB gained a lot of traction right away by giving developers the lexibility they
needed when dealing with complex data, while providing RDBMS features such as
advanced queries and easy scaling—features that eventually made MongoDB one of
the leading NoSQL solutions. JavaScript broke another boundary. But the JavaScript
revolutionaries haven't forgotten where it all began; in fact, the popularization of
modern browsers created a new wave of JavaScript frontend frameworks.

Back in 2009, while building their JSON as a platform service, developers Miško
Hevery and Adam Abrons noticed that the common JavaScript libraries weren't
enough. The nature of their rich web application raised the need for a more
structured framework that would reduce grunt work and maintain an organized
code base. Abandoning the original idea, they decided to focus on the development
of their frontend framework and open sourced the project, naming it AngularJS.
The idea was to bridge the gap between JavaScript and HTML and help popularize
single page application development. The result was a rich web framework,
which presented frontend web developers with concepts such as two-way data
binding, cross-component dependency injection, and MVC-based components.
AngularJS along with other MVC frameworks revolutionized web development by
transforming the once unmaintainable frontend code base into a structured code
base that can support more advanced development paradigms such as TDD.

## Why MEAN Stack
MEAN is an abbreviation for MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js. The
concept behind it is to use only JavaScript - driven solutions to cover the different
parts of your application.
* A single language is used throughout the application
* All the parts of the application can support and often enforce the use of the
MVC architecture
* Serialization and deserialization of data structures is no longer needed
because data marshaling is done using JSON objects
